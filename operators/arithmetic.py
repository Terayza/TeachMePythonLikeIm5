# Tutorial: What are arithmetic operators and how to use them.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Arithmetic operators all you to perform mathematical calculations in Python.
a = 5
b = 3

a + b       # addition - adds two operands together
a - b       # subtraction - subtracts the right operand from the left
a * b       # multiplication - multiplies two operands
a / b       # division - divides left operand from right
a % b       # modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right
a ** b      # exponential - left operand raised to the power of the right
a // b      # floor division - division that results in whole number adjusted to the left in the number line

# When doing more complicated arithmetic, brackets are useful to seperate calculations.
c = 10
d = 12

(((a + b) / c) * d)     # (a + b) will be performed first

# 1. Ask a user to input two numbers. Print these two numbers and show:
# (a) the sum of the numbers
# (b) the divison of the numbers (both a / b and b / a)
# (c) the modulus of the numbers (both a % b and b % a)
